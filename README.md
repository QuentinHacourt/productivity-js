# productivity-js

Welcome to my productivity-js repo!

In this repo I will store the frontend part of a productivity application.

Everything in this repository will be written in plain html/css/javascript.

For now it only has a pomodoro timer application.

## Pomodoro Timer

A simple timer application. The user can choose between three modes for now:

- Pomodoro: a 25 minute timer where you are supposed to do focused work
- Short break: a 5 minute timer where you are supposed to take a break
- Long break: a 15 minute timer where you are supposed to take a break
