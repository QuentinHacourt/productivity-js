# productivity-js

Welcome to my productivity-js repo!

In this repo I will store the frontend part of a productivity application.

Everything in this repository will be written in plain html/css/javascript.

For now it only has a pomodoro timer application.

## Pomodoro Timer

A simple timer application. The user can choose between three modes for now:

- Pomodoro: a timer where you are supposed to do focused work
- Short break: a timer where you are supposed to take a short break
- Long break: a timer where you are supposed to take a longer break

The length of each mode can be set up by the user in the settings menu.

## TODO List

A simple todo list application. The user can view the tasks he has to perform, see the details of said tasks, delete these tasks and add new ones.
